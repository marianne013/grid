For technical reasons the date the query was last run can be found at the bottom
of this page. <br>
I only list the results that are publicly available, either through the bdii,
using uberftp or via the UK Nagios.
For some EMI services it's not obvious what to use as the version. I use the
following: <br>
<b>ARC-CE:</b> nordugrid-arc version (no middleware version available) <br> 
<b>CREAM-CE:</b> GlueCEImplementationVersion <br>
<b>WN:</b>  Nagios tests (only available for CREAMCEs) <br>
<b>SE:</b> GlueSEImplementationVersion <br>
<b>site bdii:</b>GLUE2EndpointImplementationVersion<br>
<b>WMS:</b> GLUE2EndpointImplementationVersion <br>
<b>LB:</b> GLUE2EndpointImplementationVersion &amp; MiddlewareVersion<br>
<b>BDII (top):</b> MiddlewareVersion <br>
<br>
This page is generated using a 
<a href="https://github.com/marianne013/grid/blob/master/query_bdii_all_sites.py">python script</a> querying the 
site bdiis and using the results of the Nagios tests (only available for CREAMCEs) for the WN version. <br>
EMI 2 CREAMCEs/WNs/BDIIs(*) are now marked in <font color = #FF0000> red</font>. <br>
(*) It's not always obvious which version go with EMI2. <br>

<br> 
The operating system on the CREAM-CEs is determined using uberftp. 
If it's missing, it means I could not access the CE with uberftp and a dteam proxy.
There is no way to determine the operating system on ARC-CEs.
<br>
Note that the script checks everything you advertise in your bdii - if you see something in this table that shouldn't be there, please check your bdii. (Please don't advertise services that don't work and aren't likely to work in a while.)
